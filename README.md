# Overview

These hooks are utilities for the Sage auto provisioner to run either
pre or post processing on deployment of AWS resources.


These hooks will use the AWS SES service to send email notifications.
A sender name and email is required. A good email to use is the AWS account's
root email address because it has already been verified by SES.  If you prefer
to use a different sender email address and your AWS SES is still in the
[SES sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html)
then you must manually verify that email before it can be used.
